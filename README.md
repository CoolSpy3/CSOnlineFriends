# CSOnlineFriends
Adds the `/of` command to list Hypixel friends that are currently online. This command will be run automatically when you join a server.

## Deprecation
Following the [deprecation of the Hypixel Friends API](https://hypixel.net/threads/public-api-removal-of-the-friends-endpoint.5245947/) this mod cannot function without a rewrite of the core logic. If this mod would be of great use to somebody, let me know, and I can try to add some chat-parsing logic to restore functionality (similar to what I did with [CSHypixelAPI](https://github.com/CoolSpy3/CSHypixelAPI), however, until then, I don't have a use case for this mod which justifies that.
